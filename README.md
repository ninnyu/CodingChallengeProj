Issues
  - I understand basic MVP concept, but had a hard time fully implementing the app in MVP design format
    - Wasn't sure where to put the methods and queries and how the information should be passed from
      view to presenter to model back to presenter and back to model
    - Need more practice writing projects in MVP to fully understand how to write in MVP design format
  - Didn't have good ideas for AsyncTask, so I did a simple thing where it "fakes" loading the database
